Prerequisites:
Hestia Control Panel installed on your server.
A domain pointed to your server (optional, but recommended).
A Linux server running Ubuntu or Debian (Hestia supports these).
Step 1: Log into Hestia Control Panel
Open your web browser and navigate to:
arduino

https://your-server-ip:8083
Log in using your Hestia admin username and password.
Step 2: Create a New User (Optional)
You can manage everything as an admin user, but it's better to create a separate user for each website.

Go to "Users" in the Hestia dashboard.
Click on "Add User".
Fill in the details such as username, email, and password.
Assign an appropriate role (like “user”) and package (set resource limits).
Click Save.
Now, you can log in with this new user if you wish to manage WordPress under a different user account.

Step 3: Add a New Domain
Go to the "Web" section.
Click "Add Web Domain".
Enter the domain name you want to use for your WordPress site (e.g., example.com).
If you are using the server's IP instead of a domain, use the server IP or a temporary domain name.
Enable SSL and Let’s Encrypt if you want to use HTTPS (recommended).
Click Save.
Step 4: Create a Database for WordPress
Go to the "Databases" section.
Click "Add Database".
Provide a database name, username, and password for your WordPress site.
Set the type to MySQL (MariaDB).
Click Save.
Take note of the database credentials (name, username, and password), as you'll need them during the WordPress setup.

Step 5: Install WordPress
Method 1: One-Click Installer (If Hestia has WordPress Installer enabled)
Go to the "Applications" section.
Search for WordPress.
Click on Install for the domain you want to install WordPress on.
Fill in the necessary details (site name, admin email, username, and password).
Complete the installation.
Method 2: Manual Installation
If the one-click installer is not available or you prefer to do it manually, follow these steps:

Download WordPress:

You can do this either from the terminal via SSH or from the Hestia file manager.
SSH method:



cd /home/yourusername/web/yourdomain.com/public_html
wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xzvf latest.tar.gz
mv wordpress/* ./
rm -rf wordpress latest.tar.gz
Or you can upload the WordPress zip file from your local machine using the File Manager in Hestia and extract it into the public_html directory.

Set File Permissions: Make sure the web user has the proper ownership of the files:



sudo chown -R yourusername:www-data /home/yourusername/web/yourdomain.com/public_html
sudo chmod -R 755 /home/yourusername/web/yourdomain.com/public_html
Step 6: Configure WordPress (wp-config.php)
Create the wp-config.php file:

Copy the sample file:


cd /home/yourusername/web/yourdomain.com/public_html
cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
Edit the wp-config.php file:

Open the file for editing:



nano wp-config.php
Enter the database credentials you created in Step 4:

php

define('DB_NAME', 'your_db_name');
define('DB_USER', 'your_db_username');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'your_db_password');
define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
Save the file by pressing CTRL+X, then Y, and Enter.

Step 7: Complete the WordPress Installation via Browser
Open your browser and go to:
arduino

http://yourdomain.com
You should see the WordPress installation screen.
Choose your language and click Continue.
Enter your site information:
Site Title
Admin Username
Password
Admin Email
Click Install WordPress.
Once installed, log in to the WordPress admin dashboard.
Step 8: (Optional) Enable SSL with Let’s Encrypt
If you didn't enable SSL during the domain setup, you can easily enable it now:

Go to the "Web" section in Hestia.
Find your domain and click "Edit".
Scroll down to SSL Support and check the box.
Enable Let’s Encrypt SSL by checking the box.
Click Save.
This will automatically generate and apply an SSL certificate for your domain.

Step 9: Optimize and Secure Your WordPress Installation
Install Security Plugins: Consider installing plugins like Wordfence or iThemes Security for better security.
Backup Setup: Hestia provides automatic backups, but you can also install backup plugins like UpdraftPlus.
Caching and Optimization: Install caching plugins like WP Super Cache or W3 Total Cache to improve performance.
